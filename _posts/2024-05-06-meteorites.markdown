For the final project of INFO 526 - Data Analysis and Visualization, the group I was a member of investigated geospatial-temporal meteorite data to visualize insights of impact distributions. Our project website can be found <b><a href = "https://info-526-s24.github.io/project-final-VizWizards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></b>.

My major contribution to the project was an interactive Shiny dashboard where users can visualize and explore meteorite landing data over time. <b>The live application can be accessed <a href = "https://gmcginnis.shinyapps.io/MeteoriteMap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></b>, and all code are available <a href = "https://github.com/INFO-526-S24/project-final-VizWizards/blob/main/shiny_meteorites/app.R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Below, a preview of the final site is presented.
