For my inorganic chemistry course, one of the major projects was to present a peer-reviewed chemistry journal article that was related to a concept recently covered in class. Requirements for the presentation included the question/hypothesis, method, results, conclusion, and what experiment we would do next, within the span of five minutes with appropriately corresponding slides.

I decided to present on "Effect of Lewis Acids on the Structure and Reactivity of a
Mononuclear Hydroxomanganese(III) Complex" by Derek B. Rice, Elizabeth N. Grotemeyer, Anna M. Donovan, and Timothy A. Jackson ([_Inorg. Chem._ 2020, 59, 5, 2689â€“2700](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b02980)).

My slides can be accessed below or <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uKB-83sseLgjl_a8YMoemjeJtcMbkUeaaNvGOvyUpg8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Details can be found in the speaker notes.

Because I opt to use slides as a visual tool rather than something to be read off of, I worked to maximize the visual information on the slides while keeping text to a minimum.
