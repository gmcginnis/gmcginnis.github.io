[Paideia](https://www.reed.edu/paideia/) is Reed College's annual festival of learning, in which members of the Reed community are invited to participate in or lead classes and workshops about their passions. For the 2022 festival, I independently researched and presented a one hour lecture and corresponding slides on the history of and science behind chili peppers.

Due to pandemic concerns, I opted to cancel the pepper sampling session portion of the class.

My slides can be accessed below. Details can be found in the speaker notes.
