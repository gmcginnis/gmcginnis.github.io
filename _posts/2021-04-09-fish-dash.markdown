I made my first major Shiny application in April 2021, using data from the [FishBase](FishBase) API accessed via the [<code>rfishbase</code> package](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase). The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that used data downloaded via an API.

The live application can be accessed [here](https://gmcginnis.shinyapps.io/fishdash/), and all code and data are available [here](https://github.com/gmcginnis/FishDash).

Below, a preview of the final site is presented.

In addition to being able to explore depth data by applied filters, there is an additional tab that allows for a tabular exploration of the resulting data.
