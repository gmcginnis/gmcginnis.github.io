I made my first major Shiny application in April 2021, using data from the <a href = "http://fishbase.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FishBase</a> API accessed via the <a href = "https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>rfishbase</code> package</a>. The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that used data downloaded via an API.

<b>The live application can be accessed <a href = "https://gmcginnis.shinyapps.io/fishdash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></b>, and all code and data are available <a href = "https://github.com/gmcginnis/FishDash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Below, a preview of the final site is presented.

In addition to being able to explore depth data by applied filters, there is an additional tab that allows for a tabular exploration of the resulting data.
