## <b>Hello there!</b>

I'm Gillian, a Reed College alumna and master's student at the University of Arizona's College of Information Science. For my undergraduate degree I studied chemistry with a minor in English. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in information science with an emphasis in machine learning.

I'm passionate about scientific literacy and truthful & accessible data visualization. I work primarily with R and Python in my studies, with additional experience in LaTeX. During my undergraduate degree I studied in both wet and dry laboratories. I previously worked as a course assistant and IT help desk support in both hands-on and remote settings.
